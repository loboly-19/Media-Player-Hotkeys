# Media-Player-Hotkeys
This Python script listens to the Page Up and Page Down keys and simulates the media keys for skipping to the next or previous song system-wide using the pyautogui and keyboard modules. The script also blocks the Page Up and Page Down keys from any other use while it's running to prevent conflicts with other applications.
